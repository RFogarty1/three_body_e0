# ------- Parameters defining the electronic states to be used -------
#
# DataSet is the name of the subdirectory of the main directory in which the 
# data files are kept for the chosen model.
#
# SpinFlag determines whether the calculation is to be spin polarized or not.
#  0  ==>  Not spin polarized
#  1  ==>  Collinear Spin
#  2  ==>  Non-collinear spin
# If SpinFlag = 1, then a list of the initial net spin on each atom is required.
# The spin of an electron is (of course) 0.5. If you have a list of identical
# spin values, you can compress the list by writing (for example)
#   0.5 * 15
# This will give 15 identical spins. NOTE: you need the spaces on either side
# of the *
# If SpinFlag = 2, then a list of the initial net spin vectors on each atom is
# required (x, y and z components).
#
# OccupyFlag determines how the occupancies of the single particle states are
# assigned.
#  0  ==>  Use default occupancies (does not apply to metals)
#  1  ==>  Find occupancies using Fermi distribution with
#          temperature given by ElectronTemperature
#  2  ==>  User assigned occupancy. Followed by a list of the form
#          Number of elements in list
#          Occupancy #1   Number of levels with this occupancy

#          ...............
#  3  ==>  Find occupancies using Paxton-Methfessel scheme with
#          broadening given by ElectronTemperature. Following number is the
#          order of the polynomial used.
#  4  ==>  Find occupancies using Fermi distribution with
#          temperature given by ElectronTemperature and a fixed
#          total spin.  Only valid for SpinFlag = 1. Following number is the
#          the total spin.
#
# OccupyTolerance sets the tolerance on the number of electrons used when
# searching for the Fermi energy
#
# ElectronTemperature is the temperature (in Ry) that the electrons are given
# to smooth the finding of the Fermi level.
#
# BlochStates is the flag marking the list of quantities to define the k points
# to be used for a periodic calculation. Zero K points means Bloch states are
# not to be used. A positive number means that you must provide a list with
# this many K points (in reduced coordinates) with their weights (k1,k2,k3,wt)
# A value of -1 means that a Monkhorst-Pack mesh will be generated for you. You
# must provide three integers giving the number of points in each direction.
#
# ElectronExcess is the number of extra electrons to be added to the system over
# and above those contributed by the neutral atoms.
#
# excMbCorr
# 0 fract(tb1 only) ==> Do not apply a correction for many-body effects to E0
# 1 fract(tb1 only) ==> Apply a correction to E0 based on the uniform density
#                       approximation. This is multiplied by fract (e.g. usually
#                       set fract as 1.0) before being added to E0. For DFT2
#                       only the flag is currently read (fract=1.0 always)
# 2 fract(tb1 only) ==> In tb1 this says not to subtract the 2-body terms off
#                       (not really recommeneded ever). Invalid option in dft2
# 3 (dft2 only)     ==> Applies correction of 1 (which is the zeroth order term
#                       in a Taylor expansion) PLUS the second-order term in the
#                       relevant Taylor expansion.

#f_D = [sqrt((1 - \frac{r_{AN}}{R_{A}+R_{N}}) (1- \frac{r_{BN}}{R_{B}+R_{N}}) )]^p

#
# ScreenFunctAngDep determines how to treat the angular dependence of the
# calculated screening function. 
#  0  ==> No explicit Angular dependence (1 screen-funct value per bond)
#  1  ==> scale the screen function for bond I-J by 
#         0.5*f(\theta_{IJK}) + f(\theta_{JIK}). Multiple screening functions
#         then exist for each bond (f depends on the angular momenta of orbitals
#         forming the bond)  
#
# DiameterNLV is the diameter of the non-local pseudopotentials
#
# e0Method
# 0  ==> Calculate E0 exactly using numerical integration (Default)
# 1  ==> Calculate E0 using a pair potential
